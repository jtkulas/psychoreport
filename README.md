Slide tutorial for crafting a technical report with R via Quarto (only requirement for use is that [Quarto is installed locally](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)). 

If you copy/paste where prompted, you will generate a template report that includes:

1. Table of contents
2. Data analyses
3. Table
4. Figure
5. Bibliography

Quarto--specific features include:

+ Cross--references
+ Formatting (e.g., light/dark theme)

The content of this report is specific to Psychological measurement (aka "Psychometrics"), but the template should accomodate any content -- you can replace content after rendering the template document.
